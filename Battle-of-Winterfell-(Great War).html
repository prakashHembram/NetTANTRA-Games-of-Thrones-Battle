            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>Prelude<br>

                Jon Snow, King in the North, prepared the North for the White Walkers, <br> who rose again after thousands of
                years during his time in the Night's Watch. <br> He negotiated with Daenerys Targaryen during her invasion of <br>
                Westeros, eventually cultivating an ally in her. <br> Daenerys's Hand, Tyrion Lannister, came up with a plan <br>
                to capture a wight so they could convince Queen Cersei <br> Lannister to agree to a truce during the Great <br>
                War. Cersei held the Iron Throne after the War of the Five Kings and agreed to a parley in King's <br>
                Landing. In accordance with the plan, Jon and a team ventured beyond the Wall to capture a wight.br <br> The
                mission nearly failed but Daenerys, atop Drogon, rescued Jorah Mormont, Tormund, Beric Dondarrion, and
                Sandor Clegane, while Jon fought off wights to allow Daenerys and the others to flee. However, the Night <br>
                King managed to kill one of her dragons, Viserion, during the rescue mission. <br>

                The wight was presented by Jon, Daenerys, and their followers at the Dragonpit Summit before Cersei, <br>
                Euron Greyjoy, and their entourage. While Euron declared he would retreat to the Iron Islands, Cersei <br>
                agreed to a truce, and later further agreed to send her armies north to assist in the Great War after <br>
                negotiating with her brother Tyrion.[1] <br>

                After Jon and Daenerys began sailing back to the North following the parley, Cersei revealed to her <br>
                brother Jaime that she and Euron Greyjoy plotted to betray the truce that they agreed to, and that Euron
                was ferrying the Golden Company from Essos to Westeros on the Iron Fleet in order to help the Lannisters
                reconquer the Seven Kingdoms. Seeking to uphold the vow he made at the parley, Jaime abandoned his
                sister in King's Landing and rode north alone to help in the Great War against the White Walkers and the
                army of the dead.[1] Upon arriving at Winterfell, Jaime was put on trial for his actions against Houses
                Targaryen and Stark, but was ultimately allowed to stay in Winterfell while Winterfell prepared for the
                army of the dead.[2]

                Meanwhile, after rescuing his sister Yara from their uncle Euron, Theon Greyjoy set sail to Winterfell
                with some ironborn warriors. Meanwhile, Yara and the rest of their followers sailed to the Iron Islands
                to take them back from Euron in Daenerys's name, allowing the living to retreat to the Iron Islands
                should Winterfell fall.[3] Theon and the ironborn were also allowed to stay at Winterfell to participate
                in the great battle.[2]
