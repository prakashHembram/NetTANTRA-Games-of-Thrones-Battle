            <p>Prelude<br>

                "A monster has taken our home and our brother.
                <br> have to go back to Winterfell and save them both!"
                <br>â€•Sansa Stark to Jon Snow[src]<br>

                With the death of King Robb Stark and most of his bannermen at the Red Wedding,
                <br> Iron Throne names House Bolton the new ruling
                <br> House of the North. However, to cement their hold on the North following
                <br> murders of Joffrey Baratheon and Tywin Lannister,
                <br>they betray the Lannisters and secure a marriage alliance through Lord Petyr Baelish between
                <br>Sansa (formerly the Lannisters' hostage) and Ramsay Bolton,
                <br> Roose Bolton's recently-legitimized bastard son.
                <br> help from the Boltons' prisoner, Theon Greyjoy,
                <br> escapes her home during Stannis Baratheon's ill-fated attack on Winterfell and flees to Castle
                Black
                with Brienne of Tarth and Podrick Payne,
                <br> she reunites with her half-brother, Jon Snow, who was on the verge of leaving the Night's Watch
                following his death and resurrection. <br>
            <p>
                Since Sansa has escaped and is being sheltered by Jon, while Roose Bolton has recently sired a son with
                his new wife, Walda Bolton, Ramsay's position as Roose's heir is uncertain. In order to secure his
                position, Ramsay murders his father in cold blood and has his stepmother and newborn half-brother mauled
                to death by his hounds, making him the new head of House Bolton, Lord of the Dreadfort, Lord of
                Winterfell and Warden of the North.

                Sansa urges her brother to help her retake Winterfell from the Boltons but Jon,
                weary from fighting, is reluctant at first. However, Jon agrees when he receives a letter from Ramsay,
                in which Ramsay threatens Jon's younger brother Rickon and sister Sansa, as well as the wildlings. In
                the letter, Ramsay reveals he is holding Rickon hostage, and demands the return of Sansa on threat of
                murdering the wildlings and Rickon, before having Sansa gang-raped.
                Jon and Sansa resolve to march on the Boltons to save their younger brother and retake Winterfell.
