        <h1>Battle of King's Landing </h1>
        <p>The Battle of King's Landing was the final engagement of Daenerys Targaryen's war for Westeros,
            fought between the Lannister-led forces of Queen Cersei
            Lannister and the Stark, Arryn and Targaryen alliance force,
            led by Queen Daenerys Targaryen for control over King's Landing,
            the capital and largest city of the Seven Kingdoms of Westeros and seat of the Iron Throne.

            <p>Prelude<br>
             
                 "Oh yes, you'll be queen...for a time. <br> Then comes another, younger, more beautiful, to cast you down and
                take all you hold dear" <br>
                â€•Maggy's prophecy about Cersei Lannister's downfall[src] <br>

                Daenerys resumed hostilities with Queen Cersei after <br> the Great War was won and the White Walkers were
                destroyed.[1] <br> Daenerys began her campaign to take the Iron Throne, the center of <br> power from which her
                house ruled Westeros for 300 years before the <br> 
                Targaryen dynasty was overthrown by Robert Baratheon. <br>
                After the War of the Five Kings, however, the Baratheon  <br> dynasty was also left in shambles, and Cersei of
                House Lannister seized the Iron <br> Throne with none left to oppose her after destroying her gathered
                enemies.[2]  <br> Cersei promised to send her armies north to fight alongside the Targaryen, House Stark, and
                House Arryn armies against the Army of the Dead. <br> However, Cersei betrayed them and held back her forces,
                which were outnumbered by 1:4 at least by the <br> Targaryen army before the Great War.[3] She also
                reinforced her troops by hiring the Golden Company, ferried to Westeros by her prospective consort and
                ally, Euron Greyjoy, the commander of the Iron Fleet.[4] <br>

                After the Battle of Winterfell, Daenerys and her forces sailed for Dragonstone, <br> but were ambushed by
                Euron and the Iron Fleet, <br> using Qyburn's anti-dragon scorpions to kill Rhaegal and smash her fleet. The
                ironborn also took Missandei captive and delivered her to Cersei in King's Landing. <br> Daenerys, Tyrion,
                and Grey Worm parleyed with Cersei outside the gates of King's Landing, but Cersei ultimately refused to
                surrender to Daenerys and ordered the Mountain to behead Missandei before them. <br> Daenerys angrily walks
                away with her forces.[4] <br>

                Jon, having given up his crown as King in the North to Daenerys as queen <br> when she vowed to fight the
                Army of the Dead alongside him,[5] is pledged to support Daenerys with the North's forces in her resumed
                campaign.[4]. He marches south on the Kingsroad with what remains of the Dothraki and the armies of the
                North and the Vale straight towards King's Landing. <br> Two of her supporters, the new prince of Dorne and
                Yara Greyjoy, do not send any forces. Daenerys also restored House Baratheon by legitimizing Gendry, a
                bastard son of Robert Baratheon, but he is unable to rally the Stormlands in time to participate in the
                battle.[4] The Riverlands and the Reach also do not participate in the battle.[6] <br>

                Tyrion convinces Daenerys to not attack the city if the bells are rung, signaling surrender. <br> He frees
                his brother, who was captured by the Targaryen forces while trying to cross their lines, telling him to
                convince their sister to surrender and escape to Pentos. Meanwhile, in King's Landing, Cersei rounds up
                as many smallfolk as she can to create a human shield against Daenerys,[4] closing the gates to the Red
                Keep as it becomes filled up. The Hound and Arya Stark, having ridden south from Winterfell in hopes of
                killing Gregor and Cersei, make it through, but Jaime is unable to make it through and takes an
                alternate path to the Red Keep.[6] <br>
                Since Sansa has escaped and is being sheltered by Jon, while Roose Bolton has recently sired a son with
                his new wife, Walda Bolton, Ramsay's position as Roose's heir is uncertain. In order to secure his
                position, Ramsay murders his father in cold blood and has his stepmother and newborn half-brother mauled
                to death by his hounds, making him the new head of House Bolton, Lord of the Dreadfort, Lord of
                Winterfell and Warden of the North. <br>

                Sansa urges her brother to help her retake Winterfell from the Boltons but Jon,<br>
                weary from fighting, is reluctant at first. However, Jon agrees when he receives a letter from Ramsay,
                in which Ramsay threatens Jon's younger brother Rickon and sister Sansa, as well as the wildlings. In
                the letter, Ramsay reveals he is holding Rickon hostage, and demands the return of Sansa on threat of
                murdering the wildlings and Rickon, before having Sansa gang-raped. <br>
                Jon and Sansa resolve to march on the Boltons to save their younger brother and retake Winterfell.
